-- ============================================
-- FIX: Reset leaked reserved_quantity values
-- ============================================
-- Problem: reserved_quantity was never decremented for abandoned payments,
-- causing all products to show "Insufficient stock" over time.
--
-- Fix: Reset reserved_quantity to 0 for all inventory and product_sizes rows.
-- The application no longer reserves stock at payment initiation —
-- it only checks availability and deducts on confirmed payment.
-- ============================================

-- Reset general inventory reserved quantities

-- Also add SECURITY DEFINER to reserve_inventory and deduct_inventory
